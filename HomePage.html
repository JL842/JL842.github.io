<h1> My programming journey (So far) </h1>
<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap;"  >
      Welcome to my homepage, I am known as JL and I have been programming,for just over a year now! My first ever language was in luau
     which is a scripting language derived from lua and used in roblox game development. It truly set the foundation to my programming journey. 
     
     My next language was C and this had more complicated syntax then luau but through required assigment I was able to complete it programming a small game
     on the Ardruino C (a game simliar to testris).

     Along the way I had a very shallow introduction to HTML, CSS and JavaScript along with many thing to web development.

     In Janurary I then had to learn Java which I very much struggled with esecpicaly with the paradigm of object oriented programming which up until this point was 
     not able to wrap my head around and I thought I was going to fail from the assigment given out which was making a card game. But sometimes for a short time I was able
     to sit down and get through it step my step alone and I even spent around 9-10 hours straight working. Although it was not OOP but procdural it functioned quite well,
     better actaully then I thought it would do.
